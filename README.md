# ChatBob – Portfolio Chatbot  

ChatBob is a portfolio side project showcasing my interest in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and conversational AI.  
It’s a custom-built assistant that introduces me (Bob Keijzer) to recruiters and curious visitors.  
Check it out here: [ChatBob](https://chatbob.streamlit.app)

## Features
- **Streamlit UI** with an interactive chat interface  
- **OpenRouter + GPT OSS 20B** powering responses  
- **System message control** for guiding the assistant’s personality and tone  
- **Document injection** (uploaded files are naively added to the system prompt)  
- Early experiments included running **local quantized LLMs via Hugging Face**  

## Why this project?
This project started as an exploration of LLMs in practice, and grew into a personal assistant chatbot.  
It highlights my **curiosity in LLMs and agentic behavior** and inspired me to dive deeper into:  
- React frontends  
- FastAPI backends  
- Cloud deployment (Azure, AWS, GCP)  
- Identity-based integrations with external data sources  

## Status  
This is **not a production-ready product** — it’s a functional portfolio showcase.  
The goal is to demonstrate my passion for AI and serve as a stepping stone toward building more advanced agentic systems.  

**Disclaimer**  
The chatbot may occasionally produce inaccurate or incomplete information.  
It is intended as a demo of conversational AI, not as a source of guaranteed facts and may produce false information.
